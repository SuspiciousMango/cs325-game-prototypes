<h2>Black Hole Baseball!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
A puzzle game where the player doesn't have direct control over the object they are trying to move around. Instead other factors influence how the object moves, and
the player influences those factors. I also think the premise is somewhat original. Instead of going with a "get the ball to a goal" or something similar, I decided to
make it an asteroid destroying earth with the help of gravitational assists from black holes.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I had to write my own gravity code because phaser's built in "accelerateToObject" function only works on one object at a time so I couldn't have all 3 black holes influencing
the asteroid at the same time. Instead I calculated each x and y component of acceleration for each black hole and added them all together. At first I was worried that I
would need to deal with complicated inverse trig functions in order to get the angles I needed, but then I remembered sin = o/h and cos = a/h and that made everything
exponentially easier. Aside from that, I also implemented 2 different types of board resets. One only resets the position of the asteroid, and the other resets everything. 
The first is for making minor adjustments to an already existing solution that may be really close, but not quite there yet. The second is for when things really go wrong 
and the player just wants to restart.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
The hardest part of the prototype was definitely getting the acceleration to work properly. Because there could be either 1, 2, or 3 black holes on the board, the code
needed to be flexible enough to deal with all 3 of those scenarios. At first, I was hoping accelerateToObject would do what I needed it to, but it seemed to only be able
to take into account 1 object at a time, which wasn't good enough for me. At first I thought about making only the closest black hole act on the asteroid, but I decided
that it was really important to me that all of them can act on it at once, because that is how gravity works irl. Even the most distant stars have SOME gravitational effect
on us. Coming up with the actual code had its challenges, but once I refreshed my trig with a simple google search it really wasn't that bad.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets made from scratch. I looked at a couple phaser examples for syntax(things like how to properly format callbacks, the correct functions and string keys to use
for input, and the like), but no code was taken directly from any of them.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
In my analog assignment document from last week, I likened this game to Khet, a game about placing mirrored pieces on a gameboard to influence the direction of a laser.
Similarly to my game, the player has no influence over the laser itself, and must use the mirrors to influence its direction to get it to the goal. I see my game along
similar lines. The goal object cannot be directly influenced (save the initial velocity) and must be influenced indirectly by other items on the board the player has
control over.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Using the gravitational power of black holes, navigate an asteroid through space so it impacts a planet.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Using multiple gravity sources to influence an object simultaneously on a 2d plane
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Feeling of reveal as they try more combinations and learn to understand how the black holes work
Feeling of accomplishment when they successfully navigate the asteroid to the planet
Feeling of accomplishment as they attempt to optimise their solution to use fewer and fewer black holes
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Clicking the left mouse button will place a black hole where the cursor is, clicking the right mouse button will remove the last black hole placed. Pressing the arrow
keys will adjust the initial velocity of the asteroid, but it is capped at 500 units per second in either direction. Additionally, the initial velocity can only be
in one of the 2 directions, and cannot be in both. In order to increase the initial Y velocity, the initial X velocity must be 0, and vice-versa. The enter key begins
the game, and starts the physics on the asteroid. At any time, the player can press "a" or "r" to reset back to the beginning, stopping all physics and resetting the
asteroid's position. "a" only resets the asteroids position, wheras "r" also removes all black holes and sets the asteroid's initial velocity back to 0.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Trial and error. The "a" reset was included because I would consistently get really close to winning, but not quite there, and I didn't want to have to restart all the
way from the beginning. The best strategy is to find a solution that almost works and then keep making small changes to the location of the black holes until it works.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Obviously the game is set in space, but beyond that there isn't much of a story to it. There really is no reason that the player is trying to blow up the earth other than
"its the objective of the game," although I thought it would be a humorous and unexpected win condition to add to the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I think nearly anyone can enjoy this game. I've always been fascinated with orbits and representing them digitally so I could spend a while just placing black holes down
in different configurations and seeing what happens. I hope there are others like me out there that will get as much enjoyment from this game as I have.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Once the player grasps how the whole system works, it should only take a few minutes for them to find a suitable configuration and successfully navigate the asteroid
to the planet.
