<h2>Pirate Collector</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Sky, platform, and dude assets taken from <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/games/firstgame/part10">firstgame example</a> and modified slightly by me 
(added eyepatch and hook hand to phaser dude, and changed the pure green platform to a log to be more pirate-like)</li>
<li>Treasure chest images taken from <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/treasure-chest-pixel-art-animation#">OpenGameArt.org</a></li>
<li>Treasure images taken from <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/cc0-award-icons">OpenGameArt.org</a></li>
<li>Wooden step sound taken from <a href="https://mcasset.cloud/">mcasset.cloud (NOTE: this sound comes directly from Minecraft and I would most likely be infringing
copyright or something if I were to ever publish or make money off of this game. Luckily for me that isn't going to happen so i THINK my use here is ok, although I'm 
not 100% sure).</a></li>
<li>Chest key unlock sound taken from <a href="https://freesound.org/people/BeezleFM/sounds/512139/">freesound.org</a></li>
<li>Ocean waves sound taken from <a href="https://freesound.org/people/priesjensen/sounds/520770/">freesound.org</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The main code body was taken from <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/games/firstgame/part10">firstgame example</a>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
As the new pirate phaser dude, walk around the map collecting randomly spawned treasure. There are 5 in total, but each chest contains a random one!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I went for the "pirate" theme, even going so far as to resprite the phaser dude with an eyepatch and (almost invisible) hook hand.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This game uses a direct, keyboard input and a decent amount of randomness. It is a platformer designed to appeal to the collector play style.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Control via keyboard, "pausing" the game when important events happen, alternating an image between multiple sprites
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>
