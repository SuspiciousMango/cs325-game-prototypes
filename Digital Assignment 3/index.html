<h2>Pirate Collector</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The pirate take on the firstgame platformer, including modifying the 'ground' and 'dude' assets to be more pirate-themed. The randomized placement of "reward" chests.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Sprite sheets are not only used for the animation of 'dude' but also for loading the chest and the treasures. Additionally, the fact that the game temporarily
pauses when a treasure is collected and waits for the player to hit enter before continuing. Although the firstgame platformer had similar technology, I take it
a step further by resuming after a pause. In firstgame, the pause happens when you lose and there is no way to unpause.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that sprite sheets and groups are very powerful. I also got a little bit better at navigating the phaser documentation website (I used it a little bit for my
previous two projects, but I didn't quite understand how to navigate it so it wasn't all that useful in the end and there was a lot of stumbling around. With this project,
I felt a lot more confident.)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Sky, platform, and dude assets taken from <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/games/firstgame/part10">firstgame example</a> and modified slightly by me 
(added eyepatch and hook hand to phaser dude, and changed the pure green platform to a log to be more pirate-like)</li>
<li>Treasure chest images taken from <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/treasure-chest-pixel-art-animation#">OpenGameArt.org</a></li>
<li>Treasure images taken from <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/cc0-award-icons">OpenGameArt.org</a></li>
<li>Wooden step sound taken from <a href="https://mcasset.cloud/">mcasset.cloud (NOTE: this sound comes directly from Minecraft and I would most likely be infringing
copyright or something if I were to ever publish or make money off of this game. Luckily for me that isn't going to happen so i THINK my use here is ok, although I'm 
not 100% sure).</a></li>
<li>Chest key unlock sound taken from <a href="https://freesound.org/people/BeezleFM/sounds/512139/">freesound.org</a></li>
<li>Ocean waves sound taken from <a href="https://freesound.org/people/priesjensen/sounds/520770/">freesound.org</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The main code body was taken from the <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/games/firstgame/part10">phaser firstgame example</a>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
As the new pirate phaser dude, walk around the map collecting randomly spawned treasure. There are 5 in total, but each chest contains a random one!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I went for the "pirate" theme, even going so far as to resprite the phaser dude with an eyepatch and (almost invisible) hook hand.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This game uses a direct, keyboard input and a decent amount of randomness. It is a platformer designed to appeal to the collector play style.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Control via keyboard, "pausing" the game when important events happen, alternating an image between multiple sprites
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Enjoy the custom art and sound design. Feel a sense of accomplishment for finding every treasure.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player uses the left and right arrow keys to move left and right respectively, the up arrow key to jump, and the enter key to resume the game once a treasure is collected.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
As far as strategies are concerned there really is only the one: move towards treasure chest. One thing I find enjoyable is if the chest spawns in the air and the player is fast
enough, they can intercept it in the air. This has no additional effect (other than pausing the game while both the player and the chest are in the air, which is mildly funny),
but the player may feel a sense of personal accomplishment at the ability to do so.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game world is very simple. A set of logs provide ground for a lone pirate-robot-alien thing to walk around on. Throughout the world, random chests spawn with treasure in them.
The pirate is greedy and wants all the treasure to himself. Luckily for him, there is no one to compete with him for it (although that gives me an idea for a competitive version, where
two players compete to get to the chest first.)
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone and everyone who likes collecting shiny things or pirates.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Collecting all 5 treasures takes anywhere from a couple seconds to a couple minutes depending on how lucky the player gets.
</li>
