<h2>Bored in the Office</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The main focus of originality in my game is the sound design. I recorded all the voicelines myself to add personality and originality to an otherwise pretty basic game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Any idle clicker game.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Bored in the Office is about a man who is, well, bored in the office. Click on the world around him to try to entertain him. Discover what interactions are possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Instead of choosing a theme, I decided to choose a challenge: "you cannot win with sound off." In my opinion, the "win condition" of Bored at Work is the player having an enjoyable reaction to the effects, and 
although I guess technically possible, it would be very hard to have an enjoyable reaction to the game if you could not hear the voice lines I put so much effort into.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This game uses clickable buttons (although they are hidden from view) and no randomness. It is designed towards the explorer play style and could best be described as a static adventure game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The goal for the player is simply to experience the "world" created by the one scene. There should be a sense of satisfaction when they discover a new secret action and the ridiculous voice acting is designed to make the entire game humorous.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game has a very simple instruction set. The player simply clicks on the scene around them, and watches what reaction happens. Certain places on the scene are invisible buttons that, when clicked, cause some action or interaction to occur. 
If this game were to continue development, the idea is that every interaction would be fully animated, but for the sake of saving time most animations have not been implemented. I would also like to focus more on interaction rather than reaction.
For this demo, most of the responses are reactions, but eventually the addition of more interactive elements (akin to classic adventure games: "find this item here that can be used over here") would lead to more interesting gameplay and the ability 
to even have levels and transitions between them (clicking on a car in the parking lot outside may cause the scene to shift from the main character's work to his home)
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The only two "strategies" that really exist for this game are selectively clicking on things that seem like they might do something or just rapid fire clicking on everything and waiting for reactions.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game originated from the fact that I didn't have an idea for a game to make, so I decided to channel my lack of an idea into a game about being bored and not having anything to do. Since the mechanics themselves are nothing spectacular, I decided to focus 
on the visual and auditory elements to capture the player. The lore of the game can be summed up in the title: the main character is bored at work. Everything else is left up to the player to interpret or ignore as they please. They can take the game as some
metaphysical commentary, or just laugh at my looney voice acting.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone and everyone who enjoys clicking their mouse and having a good laugh.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
